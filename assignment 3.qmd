## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

Analysis section:

Based on the analysis of social media addiction's impact on students, several key findings emerge from the visualizations: Academic Performance Impact: The boxplot reveals a clear pattern where students reporting academic performance effects consistently show higher addiction scores (6-8 range) compared to those without reported effects (4-5 range). This relationship holds across all academic levels - graduate, high school, and undergraduate students. Interpersonal Conflicts: The stacked bar chart demonstrates a strong positive correlation between addiction scores and interpersonal conflicts. Students with lower addiction scores (1-3) experience minimal conflicts, while those with higher scores (6-9) show dramatically increased conflict frequency, with some experiencing up to 5 conflicts. Mental Health Correlation: The scatter plot illustrates a negative relationship between daily usage hours and mental health scores. As average daily usage increases from 2 to 8 hours, mental health scores decline from approximately 8.5 to 3.5, indicating deteriorating psychological well-being. Platform-Specific Patterns: WhatsApp users show both the highest average usage hours (6.48) and addiction scores (7.46), followed closely by TikTok users. Traditional platforms like Facebook and VKontakte demonstrate lower usage and addiction metrics. These findings support the research hypothesis that excessive social media engagement negatively impacts academic performance, interpersonal relationships, and mental health across student populations.
